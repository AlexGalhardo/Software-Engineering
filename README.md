## The 4 Steps to Competence

- 1 - Unconsciously incompetent: “you don’t know how much you don’t know”
- 2 - Consciously incompetent: “you know how much you don’t know”
- 3 - Consciously competent: “you already know how much you know”
- 4 - Wisdom: “unconsciously you don’t know how much you know”

## The 4 Ways to Spend Money - Milton Friedman

According to economist Milton Friedman, there are 4 ways to spend money:

1. Spend my money on me:
   - In this case, I have the incentive to look for the best value for money
   - Good service at a fair price
2. Spending my money on other people:
   - In this type of situation, the objective is to save money, the price is more important than the quality of the service
   - An average service for a good price
3. Spending someone else’s money on me:
   - In this case, money is spent with great attention to quality, but with little interest in seeking the best price
   - Excellent service at a high price
4. Spending someone else’s money on a third party:
   - In a situation like this, there is little incentive to care about both service quality and price
   - Bad service for a high price or good service for an extremely high price

## Principles

- “Bad software that adds value > Perfect software that adds no value.”
- “Learn to say: I DON’T Know, and if necessary, try to learn.”
- “Premature optimization: the root of all evil.”
- “Remember that dinosaurs are almost always the best references.”
- “He who thinks little makes a lot of mistakes” - Leonardo da Vinci
- "In God I trust. Everyone else must bring data.”
- “Lack of money is the root of all evil.”
- “There is no silver bullet.”
- “Make it work > Do it correctly.”
- “Increase revenue > reduce costs.”
- “SaaS > PaaS > IaaS > In-House”
- “You != Unicorn”
- “Always try to understand what is happening under the hood.”
- “Write code != program != software engineering”
- “Maintenance > Performance”
- “No metrics, no optimization”
- “Never stop questioning”
- “Software engineering is 80% THINKING about the problem, and 20% HOW to solve the problem.”
- “The more knowledge you have, the less you know. EGO = 1 / knowledge.”
- “Everyone should care about quality”
- “At least 80% of the code of good software has been redone, shortened or better yet, deleted. Less is more."
- “2+2 is not 5, no matter how many people say that.”
- “Principles > Analogy.”
- “Talk and learn from people smarter than you.”
- “Always try to use the single source of truth.”
- “Don’t reinvent the wheel. That’s what ready-made frameworks and libraries exist for.”
- “It’s always good to study a tool in depth before putting it into production.”
- “Modularization is everything.”
- “Good artists copy, great artists steal.”
- “Innovation only exists in a world of restriction, not abundance.”
- “There will always be something to improve. Done is better than perfect.”
