# Getting Started

Welcome to our guide for learning algorithms and data structures with TypeScript!

In this documentation, you will learn how to solve algorithms of different complexities using various data structures.
Additionally, you can run the code directly from your browser, eliminating the need to install anything on your
computer.

For instructions on running TypeScript code in your text editor locally, head to the next page.

:::caution

If you choose to run the code directly in your browser for the exercises, be careful not to create an infinite loop.
The code runs directly from your browser, so if you create an infinite loop, your browser may crash.
