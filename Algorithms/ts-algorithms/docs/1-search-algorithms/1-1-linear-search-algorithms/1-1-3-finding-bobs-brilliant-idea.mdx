# 3. Finding Bob's Brilliant Idea

![Finding Bob's Brilliant Idea](./img/1-1-3.png)

You're a teacher in charge of a class project where each student contributes their ideas. You've collected the project
proposals from your students, and now you need to find Bob's proposal to review it. Bob's proposal contains innovative
ideas crucial for the success of the project.

If Bob's proposal is not found, return -1.

```typescript
const projectProposals = [
  { name: "Alice", idea: "Idea A" },
  { name: "Bob", idea: "Idea B" },
  { name: "Charlie", idea: "Idea C" }
]
const targetName = "Bob"
findProposalIndexByName(projectProposals, targetName)
// Expected Output: Index of Bob's proposal (1)
```

<Editor
  editorHeight={250}
  args='[{ name: "Alice", idea: "Idea A" }, { name: "Bob", idea: "Idea B" }, { name: "Charlie", idea: "Idea C" }], "Bob"'
  expectedResult="1"
  initialCode={`type ProjectProposal = {
  name: string
  idea: string
}

function findProposalIndexByName (projectProposals: ProjectProposal[], targetName: string): number {
  return -1
}`} />
