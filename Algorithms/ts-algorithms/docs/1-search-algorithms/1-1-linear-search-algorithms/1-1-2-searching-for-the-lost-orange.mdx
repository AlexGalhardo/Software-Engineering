# 2. Searching for the Lost Orange

![Searching for the Lost Orange](./img/1-1-2.png)

You're organizing a fruit basket for a picnic. However, you misplaced one of the fruits, an orange, in the basket. Your
friend, Sarah, is allergic to oranges and cannot help you search. You need to quickly find the orange to ensure Sarah's
safety.

If there are no oranges in the basket, return -1.

```typescript
const fruitBasket = ["apple", "banana", "grape", "orange"]
const targetFruit = "orange"
findOrangeIndexInBasket(fruitBasket, targetFruit)
// Expected Output: Index of orange in the basket (3)
```

<Editor
  editorHeight={150}
  args='["apple", "banana", "grape", "orange"], "orange"'
  expectedResult="3"
  initialCode={`function findTreeIndexByBranches (fruitBasket: string[], targetFruit: string): number {
  return -1
}`} />
