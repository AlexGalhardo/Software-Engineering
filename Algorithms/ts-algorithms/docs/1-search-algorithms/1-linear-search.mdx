# Linear search

### Introduction

Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a straightforward algorithm used to find a target value within a list or an array. This search method sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or until all the elements have been examined.

To comprehend linear search in TypeScript, let's consider a basic example. Suppose we have an array of numbers:

```typescript
const numbers: number[] = [10, 5, 8, 2, 6, 3]
```

Now, let's say we want to find the index of a specific number in this array, for example 6. We would write a linear search function like this:

```typescript
function linearSearch (array: number[], target: number): number {
  if (array.length === 0) return -1 // Return -1 if the array is empty

  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { // Loop through the array
    if (array[i] === target) { // Checks if the current element is equal to the target
      return i // Return the index if the target is found
    }
  }

  return -1 // Return -1 if the target is not found
}
```

Let's use this function to find the index of the number 6 in the numbers array:

```typescript
const targetIndex = linearSearch(numbers, 6)
console.log("Index of 6:", targetIndex) // Output: Index of 6: 4
```

The function returns 4, which is the index of the number 6 in the numbers array.

Linear search is like when you look at each card in a deck until you find the card you're looking for. However, if the
deck is very large, it can take a while. The more cards there are, the longer it takes to find the right card. Other
search methods may be faster, but linear search is still important for understanding how the others work.

### Visual example

#### Element exists in array: `6`

<LinearArraySearch array={[10, 5, 8, 2, 6, 3]} element={6} />

<hr />

#### Element does not exists in array: `3`

<LinearArraySearch array={[15, 2, 6, 8, 1, 9]} element={3} />

### Other methods of linear search

#### Using `findIndex` Method:

The [findIndex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex) method in TypeScript's array prototype searches for an element that satisfies the provided testing function. Here's how you can utilize findIndex:

```typescript
function linearSearchFindIndex (arr: number[], target: number): number {
  return arr.findIndex(num => num === target)
}
```

Is it possible to use other methods like [find](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find)
or [for...of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of), but findIndex is the most efficient
for this case because it stops when it finds the first occurrence, and because it already searches for the index, which is often expected
by a linear search algorithm.

### Use cases

Linear search is commonly used in scenarios where you need to find a specific element within an array or a collection of elements. Here are some typical use cases:

1. **Small arrays**: Linear search is effective for small arrays where the overhead of implementing more complex search algorithms like binary search would outweigh the benefits.
2. **Unordered arrays**: When the array is not sorted, linear search remains a straightforward choice. Sorting the array before performing a search could introduce unnecessary complexity and overhead, making linear search a more practical option.
