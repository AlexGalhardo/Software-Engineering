# 3. Spacecraft's Navigation System

![Spacecraft's Navigation System](./img/2-1-3.png)

In a distant galaxy, a spacecraft is exploring uncharted territories. The navigation system of the spacecraft relies on
a series of unique beacon signals emitted by celestial bodies. Given a sorted array representing the frequencies of the
beacon signals, the spacecraft needs to find the frequency closest to a specified target frequency. However, due to
interference from cosmic radiation, some signals may be corrupted or missing. Implement a function to find the closest
frequency to the target frequency.

:::note

This problem can be solved by linear search as well, but make sure you solve it using binary search.

:::

```typescript
const beaconFrequencies = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]
const targetFrequency = 350
findClosestFrequency(beaconFrequencies, targetFrequency)
// Expected Output: Index of closest frequency to 350 (2)
```

<Editor

  args="[100, 200, 300, 400, 500], 350"
  expectedResult="2"
  initialCode={`function findClosestFrequency (beaconFrequencies: number[], targetFrequency: number): number {
  return 0
}`} />
