# 5. Genetic Mutation Analysis

![Genetic Mutation Analysis](./img/2-1-5.png)

In a cutting-edge genetic research facility, scientists are analyzing DNA sequences to identify potential mutations.
Each DNA sequence is represented as a string of nucleotides, where each nucleotide can be one of four letters: A, C, G,
or T. The research team has discovered that certain sequences of nucleotides are indicative of specific mutations.
Given a sorted array of DNA sequences, implement a function to search for a target DNA sequence and determine if it
contains any mutations.

:::note

This problem can be solved by linear search as well, but make sure you solve it using binary search.

:::

```typescript
const dnaSequences = ['ACGT', 'CGTA', 'GTAC', 'TACG', 'ATCG']
const targetSequence = 'ATCG'
searchForMutation(dnaSequences, targetSequence)
// Expected Output: Index of the target DNA sequence (true)
```

<Editor
  editorHeight={450}
  args="['ACGT', 'CGTA', 'GTAC', 'TACG', 'ATCG'], 'ATCG'"
  expectedResult={true}
  initialCode={`function searchForMutation (dnaSequences: string[], targetSequence: string): boolean {
  return false
}`} />
