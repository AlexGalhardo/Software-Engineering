# 4. Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform

![Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform](./img/2-1-4.png)

In a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange platform, traders are constantly buying and selling digital assets. The
platform maintains a sorted list of transaction timestamps to track the order of transactions. However, due to network
delays and processing times, some timestamps may be slightly out of order. Given a sorted array representing the
timestamps of transactions, implement a function to find the smallest missing timestamp in the sequence.

:::note

This problem can be solved by linear search as well, but make sure you solve it using binary search.

:::

```typescript
const transactions = [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
findMissingTimestamp(transactions)
// Expected Output: Smallest missing timestamp (4)
```

<Editor
  editorHeight={450}
  args="[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]"
  expectedResult="4"
  initialCode={`function findMissingTimestamp (transactions: number[]): number {
  return 0
}`} />
