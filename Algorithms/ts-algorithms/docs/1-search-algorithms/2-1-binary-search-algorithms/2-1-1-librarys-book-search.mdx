# 1. The Library's Book Search

![The Library's Book Search](./img/2-1-1.png)

In a vast library containing thousands of books, each book is labeled with a unique identification number. Librarian
Jane needs to locate a specific book requested by a patron. Given an array representing the identification numbers of
the books in the library, help Librarian Jane find the index of the book with the specified identification number.

If the specified identification number is not found, return -1.

:::note

This problem can be solved by linear search as well, but make sure you solve it using binary search.

:::

```typescript
const libraryBooks = [102, 205, 308, 410, 523, 636, 749, 852, 965, 1078]
const bookId = 410
findBookIndex(libraryBooks, bookId)
// Expected Output: Index of book with ID 410 (3)
```

<Editor
  editorHeight={450}
  args="[102, 205, 308, 410, 523, 636, 749, 852, 965, 1078], 410"
  expectedResult="3"
  initialCode={`function findBookIndex (libraryBooks: number[], bookId: number): number {
  return -1
}`} />
