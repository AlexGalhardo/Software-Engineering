# Controlling Execution Flow in GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions provides flexible ways to control the execution flow of workflows, allowing you to define conditions for when to run specific steps or jobs and specify dependencies between them. This README explains the key concepts and techniques for controlling execution flow in GitHub Actions.

## Conditional Execution of Steps and Jobs

### Using the `if` Expression

GitHub Actions allows you to conditionally execute steps or entire jobs using the `if` expression. The `if` expression evaluates a condition and runs the associated step or job if the condition is true.

#### Example:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Build and Test
      if: github.event_name == 'push'
      run: |
        # Your build and test commands here
        echo "Building and testing..."
```

In this example, the step "Build and Test" only runs when the workflow is triggered by a push event.

### Contextual Expressions
You can use contextual expressions within if conditions to access information about the workflow run, event, or repository. These expressions include github.event_name, github.ref, and more.

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to Production
      if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
      run: |
        # Deployment steps for main branch
        echo "Deploying to production..."
```

In this example, the "Deploy to Production" step only runs when a push event occurs on the main branch.

## Defining Dependencies Between Jobs

GitHub Actions enables you to specify dependencies between jobs using the `needs` keyword. When a job depends on another job, it waits for the dependent job to complete before starting.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Build and Test
      run: |
        # Your build and test commands here
        echo "Building and testing..."

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to Staging
      run: |
        # Deployment steps for staging environment
        echo "Deploying to staging..."
```

In this example, the "deploy" job depends on the "build" job, ensuring that the code is built and tested before deployment.

## Best Practices

- **Keep workflows modular:** Break down workflows into smaller jobs and steps, making it easier to manage conditions and dependencies.
- **Use descriptive step and job names:** Clear names make it easier to understand the purpose of each part of your workflow.
- **Test workflows thoroughly:** Ensure that conditional logic and job dependencies work as expected by testing different scenarios.
