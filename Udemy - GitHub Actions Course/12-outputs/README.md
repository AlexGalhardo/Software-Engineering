# Working with Outputs in GitHub Actions

In GitHub Actions, outputs allow you to pass data between different jobs within the same workflow. This can be incredibly useful for sharing results or data produced in one job with others that depend on it. Let's explore how to work with job outputs in GitHub Actions.

## Overview

- You can use `jobs.<job_id>.outputs` to define outputs for a specific job.
- Job outputs containing expressions are evaluated at the end of each job.
- Outputs that contain secrets are redacted on the runner and not exposed in GitHub Actions.

## Example: Using Outputs for a Job

Here's an example to demonstrate how outputs work in a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: GitHub Actions Outputs Example

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      result: ${{ steps.build.outputs.result }}
    steps:
      - name: Build
        id: build
        run: echo "result=success" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deployment
        env:
          BUILD_STATUS: ${{ needs.build.outputs.result }}
        run: echo "Build Status: $BUILD_STATUS"
```

In this example, the `build` job defines an output called `result`, and the `deploy` job depends on the `build` job. The result is shared from `build` to `deploy`, allowing you to pass data between these two jobs seamlessly.
