### OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

- Objective: This is a qualitative and inspiring goal that the company wants to achieve. It should be clear and motivating.
- Key Results: These are quantitative metrics that measure progress towards the objective. They are specific, measurable and have a defined deadline.

  - Objective: Improve the user's shopping experience on the website.
    - Key Result 1: Increase the website conversion rate from 2% to 3% by the end of the quarter.
    - Key Result 2: Reduce the cart abandonment rate from 40% to 30% by the end of the quarter.
    - Key Result 3: Increase the customer satisfaction score (NPS) from 70 to 80 by the end of the quarter.

### KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

- Key Performance Indicators: These are specific metrics that indicate how well the company is achieving its business objectives. - They monitor the ongoing performance of important processes and activities.
